    "abstract": "A coordinated approach capable of optimal scheduling of the responsive residential appliances to minimize the total cost of a community based scheme comprises a wind farm is suggested in this study. Here demand side loads are managed by optimizing smart appliances' operating time to minimize the cost to the community using a genetic algorithm based method. The cost optimization is obtained for different test cases using the algorithm implemented and results are discussed.",
