  "title": "F5N : Nanopore Sequence Analysis Toolkit for Android Smartphones",
  "abstract": "F5N is the first ever Android application for nanopore sequence analysis on a mobile phone, comprised of popular tools for read alignment (Minimap2), sequence data manipulation (Samtools) and methylation calling (F5C/Nanopolish). On NA12878 nanopore data, F5N can perform a complete methylation calling pipeline on a mobile phone in ∼15 minutes for a batch of 4000 nanopore reads (∼34 megabases). F5N is not only a toolkit but also a framework for integrating existing C/C++ based command line tools to run on Android. F5N will enable performing nanopore sequence analysis on-site when used with an ultra-portable nanopore sequencer (eg: MinION or the anticipated smidgION), consequently reducing the cost for special computers and high-speed Internet.",
