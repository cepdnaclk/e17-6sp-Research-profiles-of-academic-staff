    "abstract": "This paper presents a machine-checked high-level security analysis of seL4â€”an evolution of the L4 kernel series targeted to secure, embedded devices. We provide an abstract specification of the seL4 access control system together with a formal proof that shows how confined subsystems can be enforced. All proofs and specifications in this paper are developed in the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL.",
